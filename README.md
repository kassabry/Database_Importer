# Database_Importer
This repository holds the files that generates fake data for five tables and then a program that takes that fake data and imports it into a 5 table database schema.


I didn't add my database schema because I was unsure if it was necessary, but if it is I can update the repository afterward with the SQL files.
But it should be obvious that there are 5 tables that are being added to and that they are all connected one way or another.
